Hi! I'm a 4th year PhD candidate at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by [Professor Georgia Perakis](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/gperakis/). My research interests are in healthcare and service operations management, with a particular focus on developing novel analytical methods, based in machine learning and optimization, that can help companies, policy makers, and individuals make better decisions under uncertainty. I'm currently working on projects related to improving patient wait times and provider resource allocation for hospital diagnostic services, and optimizing support messaging for mental health patients. I am grateful to be supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship.
